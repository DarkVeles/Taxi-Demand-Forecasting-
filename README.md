# Taxi Demand Forecasting  
Time-series forecasting model to predict taxi demand in airport zones on an hourly basis.  
Helps optimize driver distribution during peak hours and reduce passenger waiting times.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Goals:**  
- Predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour  
- Optimize driver allocation and improve service efficiency  
- Minimize RMSE to meet target requirements  

---

## ðŸ›  **Technologies:**  
- Python, LightGBM, Scikit-Learn  
- pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

---

## ðŸ“Š **Metrics:**  
- **RMSE:** 42.5 (target < 48)  
- **Training Time:** Efficient resampling and fitting
